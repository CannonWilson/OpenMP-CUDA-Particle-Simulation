# Particle Simulation with OpenMP and CUDA

This repo contains the formatted code for my final project in UW-Madison's CS759 class on high-performance computing (HPC). This class and was great and the instructor [Dan Negrut](https://sbel.wisc.edu/negrut-dan/) was awesome!

Below is the abstract of the report I wrote for the project:

This project evaluates different approaches to the N-Body problem of simulating the
movement of particles in a vacuum due to gravity. The project reports on various
strategies one can use to speed up the calculations for this problem, and it demonstrates
the resulting performance increases. In particular, the project evaluates the differences
between sequential CPU, mult-threaded CPU, and GPU computing for use in the N-Body
problem. Finally, the project demonstrates a virtual reality (VR) application deployed on a
VR headset that lets a user see the result of the simulation.

For more info, please read the report in the "Report" folder of this repo. Here are the final videos for the project!
